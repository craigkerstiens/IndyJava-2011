# Your Server #

* You get full control
* People rely on you being up

<br/>
<br/>
* *Don't do this*


.notes This is the first option, just throw it up on your own server. Common excuses - its in beta and we release rapidly. Should you really be using this in production?

# Github #

* Awesome for development
* Awesome for collaboration

<br/>
* *Not Awesome for a Release*

.notes Github is the same case

# PyPi #

* Host it here
* If its down, the entire community knows
* There's mirrors for a reason, they help with this

.notes I'd suspect everyone here has experienced PyPi being down at some point. So you may be hesitant to host something here, it may be more flexible elsewhere. However, if PyPi's down everyone knows about it, it'll be back up. Also there's mirrors, it might be worth using them.
